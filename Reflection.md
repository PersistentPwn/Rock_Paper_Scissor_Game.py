# 🕹️ Project Reflection: Rock-Paper-Scissors

## 🌟 What I Accomplished
* **Functions:** I split my code into parts (like `main` and `check_rerun`) to keep it organized.
* **Input Cleaning:** I used `.lower()` and `.strip()` so the game isn't picky about capital letters or extra spaces.
* **The Game Loop:** I added a way for the game to restart automatically so you can play multiple rounds.

## 🔧 Things to Improve
1.  **Simplify Logic:** Right now, I have a lot of `if/elif` statements. I want to find a way to check for a winner using less code.
2.  **Validating Input:** If a user types something weird (like "pizza"), the game should just ask them to try again immediately.
3.  **Scoreboard:** I want to add a counter to track how many times the player and the computer have won.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
* **Planning is Key:** Thinking about how the game flows before writing code made it much easier to build.
* **User Experience:** I learned that small things, like handling typos, make the game feel much more professional.
* **Functions are Great:** Breaking the code into smaller pieces makes it way easier to fix bugs!
